# Eyes - macOS System Observer

An AI-native monitoring tool for macOS that provides real-time insights into system runtime behavior through intelligent log analysis and resource tracking.

## Overview

Eyes monitors your Mac's health by streaming system logs and metrics, using AI to diagnose issues before they become critical. It records actionable insights in a local dashboard and can optionally deliver them through native macOS notifications.

## Features

- **Real-time Log Monitoring**: Streams macOS Unified Logs with intelligent predicate filtering
- **Resource Tracking**: Monitors CPU, memory, GPU, disk I/O, and energy consumption via `powermetrics` and `iostat`
- **AI-Powered Diagnostics**: Deep integration with local LLMs (Ollama) or cloud APIs (OpenAI)
- **Opt-in Notifications**: Rate-limited native notifications when explicitly enabled from the CLI
- **Alert Dashboard**: Sortable trigger history with grouped similar alerts, agent reviews, resolution state, and exact rule evidence
- **Agent Triage**: A local MCP server for searching, inspecting, grouping, reviewing, and resolving alerts
- **Privacy-First**: Designed to run locally with Ollama—your system data never leaves your machine

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Rust 2021 edition or later
- (Optional) [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for local AI analysis
- (Optional) sudo privileges for enhanced metrics via `powermetrics`

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd eyes

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the application (uses default configuration)
cargo run --release

# Opt in to native macOS desktop notifications
cargo run --release -- --enable-notifications

# Or run with custom configuration and verbose logging
cargo run --release -- --config config.toml --verbose
```

While Eyes is running, open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` to view the local alert dashboard.

To connect an MCP client to the same alert database, build the binaries and register the stdio server:

```json
{
  "command": "/absolute/path/to/eyes/target/release/eyes-mcp",
  "args": ["--database", "/absolute/path/to/eyes/eyes.db"]
}
```

The MCP server can run alongside Eyes and the dashboard. See [Alerts](docs/alerts.md#mcp-server) for its tool list and behavior.

### Configuration

Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.toml`) or copy from the example:

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

The configuration supports three AI backends:

```toml
# Ollama (Local - Recommended)
[ai]
backend = "ollama"
endpoint = "http://localhost:11434"
model = "llama3"

# OpenAI (Cloud)
[ai]
backend = "openai"
api_key = "sk-..."
model = "gpt-4"

# Mock (Testing)
[ai]
backend = "mock"
```

Or use the built-in defaults by running without a config file. Eyes gracefully handles missing configuration files by falling back to safe defaults with warnings. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for all options.

## Architecture

Eyes uses a multi-threaded producer-consumer architecture:

```
Log Stream → Event Aggregator → Trigger Engine → AI Analyzer → Alert Manager
Metrics    ↗                                                   ├→ macOS Notifications
Disk I/O   ↗                                                   └→ SQLite History → Web Dashboard
                                                                                └→ MCP Server
```

### Components

- **Log Collector**: Interfaces with `log stream` to capture system logs
- **Metrics Collector**: Gathers resource data via `powermetrics`
- **Disk Collector**: Monitors disk I/O activity via `iostat` and filesystem events
- **Event Aggregator**: Maintains rolling buffers of recent events
- **Trigger Engine**: Applies heuristic rules to determine when AI analysis is needed
- **AI Analyzer**: Coordinates analysis with LLM backends and generates actionable insights
- **Alert Manager**: Delivers rate-limited native notifications and persists trigger, analysis, and delivery lifecycles to SQLite
- **Web Dashboard**: Serves all admitted trigger candidates and expands completed AI assessments when available
- **MCP Server**: Exposes local alert discovery and triage operations to agents over stdio

## Command Line Interface

Eyes provides a comprehensive CLI for configuration and operation:

```bash
# Show help and available options
cargo run -- --help

# Run with custom configuration (gracefully falls back to defaults if missing)
cargo run -- --config config.toml

# Enable verbose logging
cargo run -- --verbose

# Combine options and opt in to desktop notifications
cargo run -- --config config.toml --verbose --enable-notifications
```

See [CLI Documentation](docs/cli.md) for complete usage details.

## Development

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with verbose logging (via CLI flag)
cargo run -- --verbose

# Run with environment variable (alternative)
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Lint with clippy
cargo clippy
```

### Testing

The project uses multiple testing strategies:

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests with mocked dependencies
- **Property-Based Tests**: Uses `quickcheck` to verify correctness properties
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with actual system tools

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run property-based tests with more iterations
cargo test --release
```

## Permissions

Eyes requires specific macOS permissions:

- **Full Disk Access**: Required to read Unified Logs (System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Full Disk Access)
- **Notifications**: Requested automatically on first alert
- **Sudo Access**: Optional, for enhanced metrics via `powermetrics`

## AI Backend Options

### Ollama (Recommended)

Local LLM execution for complete privacy:

```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama

# Pull a model
ollama pull llama3

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve
```

### OpenAI

Cloud-based alternative for enhanced capabilities:

```toml
[ai]
backend = "openai"
api_key = "sk-..."
model = "gpt-4"
```

### Mock (Testing)

For testing and development without AI dependencies:

```toml
[ai]
backend = "mock"
```

The Mock backend provides canned responses and requires no external services, making it ideal for testing, development, and demonstrations.
